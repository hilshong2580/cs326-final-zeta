## Overview
___________________________________________________________________

U-Car is a carpool website that can help Umass Amherst’s students who need to use a car or seek a partner. Students can post and search their requests, and the student’s driver can post the route with time, starting location, ending location. Also, they can discuss detail in the post. The data contain photos, descriptions, dates, comments, ratings, etc.
The project ideas come from the daily needs for transportation and looking for some partners/friends so that making more fun on the trip. We don’t want it is just like the Uber. Therefore, the trading object is totally depending on the users. It can be a story, a cup of coffee or just cash, etc. Umass Amherst has a lot of international students and in-state students who do not have car or drive licenses.  For example, students cannot purchase too many items in the market. Students cannot go to Boston to do personal things on weekends. Someone may say that can be solved by Uber. However, only a few Ubers exist in Amherst. It cannot go for the far trip. As a result, U-Car can solve the embarrassing situation.
