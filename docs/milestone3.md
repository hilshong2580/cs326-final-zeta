## Documentation:Database implementation
___________________________________________________________________
As first required to do, we create the database to store all the data for our application.
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/createdatabase.png)

Then created tables with following codes (We create five table which are:userTable, postTable, commentTable, activityTable, favTable):
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/tables.png)

-For userTable:
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/creatusertable.png)

-For postTable:
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/createposttable.png)

-For commentTable:
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/createcommenttable.png)

-For activityTable:
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/createactivitytable.png)

-For favTableï¼š
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/createfavtable.png)


So, they will create the tables in database as like this:
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/tables.png)

The userTable contains password, name, email, phone and about as column names.
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/usertable.png)

The postTable contains userId, title, destination, outset, dateTimeStart, dateTimeEnd, numOfPeople, description and photo as column names.
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/posttable.png)

The commentTable contains postId, name and comment as column names.
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/commenttable.png)

The favTable contains userid, postid, postTag as colums names.
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/favtable.png)

The activityTable contains userId, favorite, post, comment as column names.
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/activitytable.png)

There are all the functions we use to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete operations on the Database:

-POST method route to get the user information once login in:
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/getuserinfo.png)

-POST method to get activities
![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/getac.png)

Then, we have a secrets.json file to store Local PostgreSQL credentials

![alt text](https://github.com/hilshong2580/cs326-final-zeta/blob/main/docs/screenShot3/credentials.png)

And then we have those functions to get into the PostgreSQL and the Heroku database:
