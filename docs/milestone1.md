## Innovative Idea
___________________________________________________________________

U-Car is a carpool website that can help Umass Amherst’s students who need to use a car or seek a partner. Students can post and search their requests, and the student’s driver can post the route with time, starting location, ending location. Also, they can discuss detail in the post. The data contain photos, descriptions, dates, comments, ratings, etc.
The project ideas come from the daily needs for transportation and looking for some partners/friends so that making more fun on the trip. We don’t want it is just like the Uber. Therefore, the trading object is totally depending on the users. It can be a story, a cup of coffee or just cash, etc. Umass Amherst has a lot of international students and in-state students who do not have car or drive licenses.  For example, students cannot purchase too many items in the market. Students cannot go to Boston to do personal things on weekends. Someone may say that can be solved by Uber. However, only a few Ubers exist in Amherst. It cannot go for the far trip. As a result, U-Car can solve the embarrassing situation.

## Important Data

## User Interface
___________________________________________________________________

This will be the login page for U-Car. All users are starting with this page to log in so that they can access the main page. If students forget the password, they can get an email to find their password. Therefore, the Username is a necessary part of the forget-password. The website should send an email based on the email which registers for that username.

As the website for UMass students, we need to create an account with UMass email. A username and password for login. An image or photo to be the icon. And the description to introduce himself/herself.

After logging in with a valid account, the users can preview all the posts on U-Car. They can use the filter to search for what they are interested in. If students have a need who can create a post and post it on the main page. They can also see all the comments by other users and leave any comments to interact with other users. Discuss the detail and supply more info.
